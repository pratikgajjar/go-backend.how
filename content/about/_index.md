Hi There 👋

I'm Pratik. As a software engineer, I enjoy tackling both technical challenges and everyday problems. My passion lies in finding solutions and making improvements where possible, whether that means optimizing AWS costs, enhancing server response times, or streamlining processes.

# A Typical Workday

My workdays begin by checking emails and Slack messages where I've been mentioned. I ensure I'm up-to-date on important communications and contribute to engineering discussions, offering help when needed.

After that, I dive into my assigned tasks, focusing on problem-solving and continuous learning. Each day, I aim to learn something new or explore useful resources to expand my knowledge. My workdays are filled with collaboration, problem-solving, and personal growth through [learning](https://www.notion.so/b5b4b75a130f4e9db5fcabed50f7750f?v=40bbd11a1be244549563924afd17634e).

**Fun fact:** Our Slack bot sends thank-you messages to a public channel when you use `@username ++`. I reflect once a week and give ++ to show appreciation.

# A day off

On non-work days, I enjoy various activities such as catching up on technology-related blogs to stay informed about the latest trends; dedicating time to investing in and tracking stocks and mutual funds portfolios for financial well-being; engaging in sports like daily running for physical fitness and mental clarity, watching or practicing football, and playing table tennis or badminton with friends or family; and unwinding by binge-watching shows on Netflix or exploring new anime series. My days off are a balanced mix of staying informed, being financially savvy, maintaining physical fitness through various activities, and enjoying quality entertainment.
