# As of April 2021

As a backend engineer at FamPay, I find joy in tackling various engineering challenges and even some non-engineering problems. My passion lies in problem-solving, regardless of the nature of the task at hand.

# A Typical Day In My Work Life

My workday usually starts by going through emails and checking Slack messages where I've been tagged. I make sure to stay up-to-date with any important communications and address engineering-related issues in public threads, offering my assistance whenever possible.

After that, I focus on the assigned tasks and work on solving the problems at hand. I believe in continuous learning, so I make it a point to discover something new each day. If there are any useful links or resources, I take the time to explore them further and expand my knowledge. Overall, my day is filled with collaborating, problem-solving, and personal growth through [learning](https://www.notion.so/b5b4b75a130f4e9db5fcabed50f7750f?v=40bbd11a1be244549563924afd17634e).

PS: We have a very cool Slack bot that sends thank-you messages to a public channel when you do @username ++. I reflect once a week and give ++ (thank you).

# Leisure Day

On my non-work day, I like to indulge in various activities:

1. [Learning](https://l.prga.in/reading): I mostly focus on technology-related blogs to stay updated with the latest trends and developments.

2. [Financial](/tags/finance/): I spend time investing in and tracking stocks and mutual funds portfolios to ensure my financial well-being.

3. [Sports](/tags/sports/): I enjoy both watching and playing football, table tennis, and badminton, which keeps me active and entertained.

4. [Entertainment](/tags/entertainment): I love binge-watching shows on Netflix and exploring different anime series to unwind and relax.

Overall, my leisure day is a perfect blend of staying informed, being financially savvy, staying active through sports, and enjoying quality entertainment.
