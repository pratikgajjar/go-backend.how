In my experience as a backend engineer, I've observed various patterns in how people seek help when they encounter problems. Understanding these patterns not only aids in providing effective assistance but also helps in fostering a culture of collaborative problem-solving.

# Types of Help Seekers

## The Persistent Problem Solver

**Effort Level:** High  
**Difficulty:** High

These individuals come to you after trying multiple approaches to solve the problem on their own. They have already narrowed down the issue to a certain extent and are often seeking confirmation or a new perspective.

### Characteristics

- Detailed explanation of what they've tried
- Specific questions
- High level of engagement

## The Exhausted Effort

**Effort Level:** High  
**Difficulty:** High

These people have exerted all their effort to solve the issue but haven't succeeded. They turn to others as a last resort, hoping for that one piece of advice that will resolve their problem.

### Characteristics

- Exhaustive list of attempted solutions
- High frustration level
- Eager for guidance

## The Unrelated Connector

**Effort Level:** High  
**Difficulty:** Medium

This group has faced similar problems in the past but struggles to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated issues. They need help to bridge the gap in their understanding.

### Characteristics

- Previous experience with related problems
- Inconsistent ability to draw parallels
- Requires help with context

## The Direct Seeker

**Effort Level:** Low  
**Difficulty:** Unknown

These individuals face a problem and immediately seek help without attempting to solve it themselves. They assume someone else can resolve it more efficiently.

### Characteristics

- Minimal initial effort
- Assumes others have ready solutions
- Potentially unaware of problem complexity

## The Delegator

**Effort Level:** Low  
**Difficulty:** Low

This group is familiar with the problem but prefers not to solve it themselves. They seek help because someone else can do it faster or it's outside their perceived job scope.

### Characteristics

- Recognizes the problem
- Prefers delegation
- Low engagement in the resolution process

# Reactions to Solutions

## The Inquisitive Learner

These individuals are deeply interested in the solution and aim to prevent similar issues in the future.

### Characteristics

- Inquires about the solution details
- Proactively seeks to prevent recurrence
- Asks clarifying questions

## The Solution Seeker

These people are focused solely on resolving the immediate issue.

### Characteristics

- Interested in the solution, not the process
- Struggles to answer detailed questions
- Limited engagement beyond immediate needs

## The Disinterested

This group has no interest in the problem or solution; they just want it resolved.

### Characteristics

- Indifferent to problem details
- Minimal engagement
- Focused on quick resolution

# Communication

Smart help seekers often choose non-blocking communication methods such as Slack messages and make their issues known in public channels. This not only allows them to receive help but also keeps others informed, fostering a collaborative environment.

## Not recommended

- Phone / WhatsApp call
- Reach out on Direct Message / Personal Email

# Conclusion

Understanding the psychology behind how people seek help can significantly improve how we assist them. By recognizing these patterns, we can tailor our responses to meet their needs effectively, fostering a more productive and collaborative work environment.
