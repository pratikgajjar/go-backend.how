In [Part 1](/posts/building-blazingly-fast-pre-owned-car-platform-with-valkey-part-1) of our series, we explored the foundational aspects of our platform's performance optimization. We began by defining our business model, which combines a marketplace and inventory system to facilitate car sales. We detailed the user flow, including how users view ads, generate leads, and book test drives. Our primary focus was on enhancing the performance of _individual car pages_, where we discussed various strategies to reduce latency and improve load times. We examined the impact of client-side versus server-side rendering and outlined initial approaches to optimizing both frontend and backend components.

In Part 2, we will focus on building and optimizing the listing page using Valkey. We will explore how to handle complex filters, manage pagination efficiently, and ensure the listing page loads quickly to provide an excellent user experience.

We will review the existing design and discuss how we mapped our business use cases to Valkey to significantly reduce response times. This will include an exploration of how to handle complex filters, manage pagination effectively, and leverage Valkey's capabilities to ensure that the listing page delivers a fast and seamless user experience.

# What ?

Listing Page - A catalog of cars with basic information and filter or order list of cars.

# Why ?

As we discussed in part-1, ~40-60% ads leads to listing page which shows list of cars. So we want to reduce page load time to reduce bounce rate.

# Specification

- Filters
- Pagination
- Recommendation Model

# Filters

In any ecommerece site, you have ability to filter the listing to narrow down what you are looking for. Here lets review how this works behind the scene using database.

## Database

To simplify and address sufficient edge cases, we've explored a partial schema.

### Backend

In the backend, we are using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to create REST APIs, alongside the [django-filter](https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/usage.html) library to easily add complex filters.

```py
from django_filters import rest_framework as filters

class CarFilterSet(filters.FilterSet):
    """Custom filter class for filtering user, you can add different filter attributes later"""
    city_id = filter.NumberFilter(name="locality__city__id", field_name="city_id", lookup_expr="in")
    price_min = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='gte')
    price_max = django_filters.NumberFilter(name='price', lookup_expr='lte')
    make = django_filters.NumberFilter(name="varient__model__make__id", lookup_expr="in")
    model = django_filters.NumberFilter(name="varient__model__id", lookup_expr="in")
    color = django_filter.NumberFilter(name="color__id", lookup_expr="in")
    features = filter.NumberFilter(name='features__id', lookup_expr='in')
    slug = filter.SlugFilter()

    class Meta:
        model = Car
        fields = [
            "make",
            "model",
            "year",
            "color",
            "price",
            "slug"
        ]
```

In views.py, we define how to process the request. Here below viewset gets executed with each request where internally django will apply the filters to the queryset, paginate and serialize the objects into JSON response.

```py
from rest_framework import viewsets, mixins
from rest_framework.filters import OrderingFilter
from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
from .filters import CarFilterSet

class CarViewSet(viewsets.GenericViewSet, mixins.ListModelMixin):
    """
    A viewset that provides the standard actions for the User model,
    including filtering using CarFilterSet.
    """
    queryset = Car.objects.all() # django lazy queryset
    serializer_class = CarSerializer # converts django orm objects into json
    filter_backends = (DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter) # django filters
    filterset_class = CarFilterSet # custom filterset
    ordering_fields = ["price", "year"]
    pagination_class = CarPagination

```

### Request

```sql
GET https://api.car.com/listing/?city_id=1&price_min=200000&price_max=400000&make_id=121,120&

SELECT ... FROM car
    LEFT JOIN locality on car.locality_id = locality.id
    LEFT JOIN city on locality.city_id = city.id
    LEFT JOIN varient on car.varient_id = varien t.id
    LEFT JOIN model on varient.model_id = model.id
    LEFT JOIN make on model.make_id = make.id
  WHERE
    city.id in (1,)
    AND car.price > 200000
    AND car.price < 400000
    AND make.id in (121, 120)
LIMIT 10 -- = page_size
OFFSET 0 -- = page_no * (page_size - 1) ; 1 <= page_no <= max_page
-- max_page = Math.ceil(count / page_size)
```

### Response

```json
HTTP 200 OK
{
  "count": 1023,
  "next": "https://api.car.com/listing/?page=3",
  "previous": "https://api.car.com/listing/?page=1",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "images": [
        "https://cdn.car.com/1/front.webp",
        "https://cdn.car.com/1/left.webp",
        "https://cdn.car.com/1/right.webp",
        "https://cdn.car.com/1/back.webp"
      ],
      "price": 721000,
      "model_name": "Nexon",
      "varient_name": "XM",
      "link": "/user-cars/1",
      "city_name": "Mumbai",
      "owner": "1st"
    }
    . . . = page_size cars
  ]
}
```

To improve SEO, we implemented dynamic slugs in our URLs, making them more human-friendly. For example, when someone searches for "Used Nexon car" on Google, our indexed page will already have a URL that reflects this search term. This approach enhances our search visibility and aligns our URLs with user queries, increasing the likelihood of attracting relevant traffic.

```sql
üåê https://car.com/used-nexon-cars-in-mumbai
-- client takes path and sends as slug query param to the backend
GET https://api.car.com/listing/?slug=used-nexon-cars-in-mumbai
```

In this case, the `SlugFilter` will parse the tokens from the URL and use a database table to return the appropriate query string. For any given `SlugFilter`, a valid query string combination will always exist as it is a subset of the overall filters.

```md
user-nexon-cars-in-mumbai => model=121&city=1
```

| id  | value  | type      | filter |
| --- | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| 1   | nexon  | model     | 121    |
| 2   | mumbai | city      | 1      |
| 3   | 4-lakh | price     | 400000 |
| 4   | tata   | make      | 2      |
| 5   | petrol | fuel_type | 1      |

## ValKey

We will go through how to model the data in-memory. Let's go core data structures of ValKey for our usecase. We want ability to filter results and fetch details in minimum amount of round trip to ValKey[^1] with optimal space usage.

- Platform will have ~1000-5000 active cars that we need to cache.

### Why Hash Set ?

- To store car detail shown in list response
- Using `HMGET car: 101 102 103`, we can fetch the data of 3 cars, based on page size we can supply list of IDs to fetch JSON
- We could store data in key-value format, `car:101 -> JSON`, here `car:` prefix with each key would also use memory. HSET also by default does the compression up to certain size.
- Maximum page_size is 35, so at max we would fetch 35 car JSON via `HMGET`

#### Invalidation

- As covered in part-1 we are listening to database change log so whenever any details of car that affects response payload we will update the Hash set.
- When car status changes to terminal state, we would remove the key from Hash set

```mermaid
graph TD
    C[Hash Set]
    C -->|car:| D[Hash Map]
    D -->|101| E(String)
    D -->|102| G(String)
    D -->|103| H(String)
```

### Why Sorted Set ?

- We could use `SORT list BY order` [^2] but it is expensive op. With complexity of O(N+M*log(M)) where N is the number of elements in the list or set to sort, and M the number of returned elements.
- Using sorted set we can filter car list by attributes using set theory[^4].
  - `ZRANGEBYSCORE car:price 100000 500000` - Cars with price between 100K INR to 500K INR
  - `ZRANGEBYSCORE car:color 5 5` - Cars with color_id = 5
  - With complexity O(log(N)+M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements returned.
- When sort order is price, date_added or any other car attributes we will store this filtered sorted list in sorted set and use it for pagination in subsequent requests. Example, key = `page:price:{queryhash}`, ttl = `10 min`
  - Best case scenario, using combination of cached sorted set and hash set. We can build result page.
  - `ZRANGE | ZREVRANGE page:price:hash 11 20`, ZRANGE for ascending order and ZREVRANGE for descending.
  - `HMGET car: 101 108 110 150 123 120 121 156 158 160`

```mermaid

graph TD
    L[Sorted Set - ZSet]
    L -->|car:color| M[Sorted Set]
    M -->|101| N(1)
    M -->|102| O(4)
    M -->|103| P(6)

    K[Sorted Set - ZSet]
    K -->|page:price:2834c5ac15373be27f| X[Sorted Set]
    X -->|101| U(100000)
    X -->|102| I(400000)
    X -->|103| G(600000)
```

### Why Set ?

When sort order is recommendation, order of cars changes based on buyer persona. We used to train model every 45 min, thus order also can change every 45 min and we would. While calculating queryhash we consider only car related filters as function input. This helps when most buyers are looking at the base page like cars in mumbai city.

#### Cache-Hit

1. Fetch filtered car list
2. Supply it to recommendation engine
3. Paginate
4. Fetch car details via `HMGET`

```mermaid
graph TD
    G[Set]
    G -->|page:reco:2834c5ac15373be27f| H[Set of Values]
    H --> I(1)
    H --> J(5)
    H --> K(11)

```

### Cache-Miss

In case we don't have list of cars cached in sorted set or set post query hash calculation, we need to build those set in this case.

1. Calculate query string hash, with property of `F('city_id=1&color=3') eq F('color=3&city_id=1')`
2. Cache-Miss - Need to build
3. Using combination of set operations build target set with filters

- `ZINTERSTORE` - set intersection
- `ZUNIONSTORE` - set union

4. `ZRANGEBYSCORE` - fetch car ids based on required order.

In certain cases at application (web server) we did the set operations to compute the final set.

```py
def filter_by_price(redis_con, price_min=None, price_max=None):
    min_value = price_min if price_min else '-inf'
    max_value = price_max if price_max else '+inf'
    return redis_con.zrangebyscore(
        name="car:price",
        min=min_value,
        max=max_value
    )
```

#### Dealing with many-to-many relationship

In case you have noticed we have Features table with MxN relationship with Cars table via CarFeatures. As one car can have many features and one feature could be there with multiple cars. How are we filtering here ?

In such cases, instead of going with `car:color` sorted set, we keep sorted set of each feature, `car:feature:{id} -> {car_id} -> 1`

Now we can use intersection and union on these sets to compute the filter.

#### Reducing network round trips

Valkey pipelining[^3] is a technique for improving performance by issuing multiple commands at once without waiting for the response to each individual command.

Pipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the round trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations you can perform per second in a given Valkey server. This is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from the point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply, but it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This involves calling the read() and write() syscall, that means going from user land to kernel land. The context switch is a huge speed penalty.

When pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single read() system call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single write() system call. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second initially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually reaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining.

We utilised the pipelining method to reduce round trips on Cache-Miss.
