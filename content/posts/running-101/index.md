# Setting Goals

I am a 27-year-old software engineer writing in the year 2024. I spend most of my time sitting for work, and since grade 12, I've been aspiring to have a six-pack as it's often seen as 'cool.' As a football fan, I'm aware that players typically peak between their late twenties and early thirties, with an analysis by The Athletic[^1] suggesting that the optimal age for different positions ranges from 27 to 31 years old. Thus, I set myself the goal of reaching peak physical fitness by my late twenties.

However, I am more inclined towards outdoor activities than hitting the gym. I would much prefer playing sports outdoors for hours rather than working out indoors. Therefore, I've set a new goal: reducing my body fat percentage to around 8%. This is because everyone has abdominal muscles; they're just hidden beneath layers of fat.

# Plan

Among the various options available for outdoor physical activity, I chose running due to its minimal effort requirement and ease of execution. To facilitate this plan:

_Footwear:_ I wear Skechers running shoes for all my runs.

_Attire:_ I ensure I have comfortable, well-fitting clothing suitable for running.

_Running Routes:_ In urban areas, I prefer peaceful roads and public parks in metropolitan cities.

Given my background in tech, where continuous measurement of metrics helps maintain system efficiency and detect anomalies, I wanted to apply the same principle to my fitness journey. To accurately track progress, I invested in a Garmin watch that records multiple metrics with high precision. The saying "If you can measure it, you can improve it" applies here; tracking quantifiable data enables better understanding of my performance and facilitates continuous growth.

# Execution

To begin my running journey safely, I took things slow initially to minimize the risk of injuries. As a newcomer, it is common to make mistakes, and rushing into intense workouts could lead to strains or other issues. Having previously completed a 4K run in around 38 minutes with no prior preparation, I decided to set a more achievable goal for my initial plan.

I utilized Garmin's AI coach feature to create a personalized running schedule aimed at completing a 5K in approximately 35 minutes – a challenging but manageable target. Fortunately, the AI coach did an excellent job generating a varied training program that included:

- Different types of runs (e.g., steady-paced, interval, and hill training)
- Strategic rest periods to allow for recovery

Now, with my customized plan in hand, I have clear guidance on when and how much to run each day, based on the initial data gathered from my first few sessions. This structured approach has helped me maintain consistency while minimizing the risk of injury.

## How to breath ?

Why ? our body needs oxygen to pump those muscles and lungs provides oxygen that goes into bloodstream. Here higher the VO2 Max, easier it becomes to run easily. To increase VO2 Max, one needs to run.

In general, body figures out what to do when in rhythm of running. I generally try to breath in and out from nose as much as i can, again not applying force if needs to exhale or inhale via mouth it's okay. When you watch Olympic runners running you'll notice they run with pretty relaxed posture and breathing. Taking full breath is important. Thus, I try to inhale for 2-3 steps then exhale in 2 steps, in case out of breath inhale from nose in 2-3 steps and exhale via mouth.

## Foot strike ?

Defined based on strike of the foot.

It comes naturally, whatever it is it's okay although heel strike in less recommended.

When I started for first 2-3 runs I was heel striker, next 2-3 runs I went with front foot and oh at start muscles were not strong so felt slight pain, later on doing this regular basis not more pain in backfoot.

### Forefoot strike

Forefoot runners land on the ball of their foot or on their toes. As they stride, their heel may not hit the ground at all. This stride can cause your body to lean forward. It may put additional strain on your toes and calf muscles.

Landing on the balls of the feet is considered effective. But landing on the toes may cause injury if you’re a distance runner. Although it’s effective for sprinting and short bursts of speed, landing too far forward on your toes isn’t recommended for longer distances. It could lead to shin splints or other injuries.

Common injuries: You may be more prone to injure your ankle, Achilles tendon, or shins.

### Midfoot strike

Considered the most “neutral” strike, midfoot strikers land in the center of their foot, with their body weight evenly distributed to the ankles, hips, back, and knees. Midfoot runners may be able to run efficiently and with speed.

Common injuries: You may experience foot, ankle, or Achilles pain at some point.

### Heel strike

As mentioned, heel strikers hit the ground with their heels first before the rest of their foot hits the ground. This can put additional strain on the knees. [^2]

Common injuries: You may be more prone to knee and hip pain.

## Running efficiently ?

{{< youtube id=_kGESn8ArrU start=155 loading=lazy >}}

### Pace (min/km)

This metric represents the time it takes to run one kilometer (min/km). It gives you a clear understanding of how fast you're running.

Monitoring your pace helps in maintaining a steady and consistent speed throughout a run. It’s essential for improving race times or reaching specific goals, as you can adjust your speed based on your target pace.

### Heart Rate (HR)

Your heart rate measures how many times your heart beats per minute (bpm) during a run.

Tracking your heart rate is crucial for understanding effort levels. It helps you ensure you’re training in the correct intensity zone to avoid overexertion or undertraining. It’s especially helpful for endurance training, where maintaining a lower heart rate can allow for longer durations of running.

### Power

Power (measured in watts) reflects the amount of effort or energy output during running.

It allows you to gauge the actual energy you're using to run, independent of pace and terrain. Power-based training can help you improve efficiency, as it enables you to maintain a constant energy output, even if terrain or conditions change.

### Cadence

Cadence is the number of steps you take per minute (spm).

A higher cadence (typically between 170–190 spm) is generally associated with more efficient running and less risk of injury. Focusing on cadence can help you refine your running form and reduce unnecessary impact forces.

| Percentile in Zone | Cadence Range |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| > 95%              | >185 spm      |
| 70-95%             | 174-185 spm   |
| 30-69%             | 163-173 spm   |
| 5-29%              | 151-162 spm   |
| < 5%               | < 151 spm     |

### Stride Length

This is the distance covered between each step while running, typically measured in meters.

Improving your stride length can increase your speed without significantly increasing effort. However, it needs to be balanced with cadence to maintain efficiency and avoid overstriding, which can lead to injury.

### Vertical Ratio

Vertical ratio measures the amount of vertical movement (bounce) in relation to stride length, expressed as a percentage.

A lower vertical ratio indicates more efficient forward movement rather than bouncing up and down. Reducing this "bounce" can help conserve energy and make your running motion smoother.

### Vertical Oscillation

Vertical oscillation is the amount of upward movement (in centimeters) during running.

Lower vertical oscillation means less wasted energy in moving up and down. By minimizing vertical movement, you can focus more energy on forward motion, improving your running economy.

### Ground Contact Time (GCT)

GCT is the time your foot spends in contact with the ground during each stride, measured in milliseconds.

Shorter ground contact times often indicate a more efficient, quicker stride. Elite runners tend to have shorter GCT, which can help reduce impact and improve speed.

### Heart Rate Zones

Heart rate zones are ranges of heart rates that correspond to different levels of effort, usually divided into 5 zones, from easy (zone 1) to maximum effort (zone 5).

Training in the appropriate heart rate zones can optimize your workout for different goals, such as fat burning, endurance, or speed. It helps prevent overtraining and ensures you're getting the right intensity in your runs.

### Time in Power Zone

Power zones are similar to heart rate zones, but based on your power output in watts. Time in power zone refers to how long you spend in each zone.

This metric helps balance your power output during different phases of a run. Spending the right amount of time in different power zones can help with endurance, speed training, and efficient energy use.

## Streching

Before each run I do 5 min warm up and post run 5/10 min cooldown.

## Music

When I started my avg cadence was ~120 spm, being more efficient was necessary. I was in <5% runner range who ran at below 151 spm. Music helped me tune as per my target cadence rhythm.
