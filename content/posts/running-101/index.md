# Hi

I am 27 year old software engineer (year 2024) who spends most of the time sitting for work. Since 12th grade I have been thinking about getting 6 packs because it's cool. Being football fan, I was aware that 22-29 are peak years for footballers and even analysis done by [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2935360/2021/11/15/what-age-do-players-in-different-positions-peak/) suggests that peak age is around 27. Thus, I set myself on goal to reach peak physical fitness. Now, I'm more of outdoor person so hitting gym isn't something comes from within. I would rather play sports for hours, or be outdoor. So this time I set different goal, reducing body fat percentage to about 8% because everyone is born with 6 packs it's just hidden.

# Plan

Among many options, I figured that running is something that requires very low effort to execute.

Shoes - I wear sketchers running shoes everywhere.

Clothes - Always have decent pair comfortable for running.

Track - In town, peaceful road and public parks in metro cities.

Being in tech, we continuously measure many kinds of metric to ensure system is working as expected and if there is anomaly we can pinpoint what caused problem. I wanted to do same, number one rule when it comes to data is Garbage in, Garbage out. I wanted system which can measure many metrics with very high accuracy. So, I got myself Garmin watch. To attain growth, what can be measured can be improved.

# Execution

Taking things slow, when people are new more often mistakes are made. I can't afford injury and running blinding could cause injury. Earlier I had participated in 5K running challenge organised by our company, I did 4K in around 38min without any preparation. So I created plan with Garmin AI coach that run 5K in 35 min, which felt not too difficult and not too easy. Thankfully, It did pretty good job in creating running schedule with various type of running and including rest periods. Now I have plan exactly when to run and how much based on my first data.

## How to breath ?

Why ? our body needs oxygen to pump those muscles and lungs provides oxygen that goes into bloodstream. Here higher the VO2 Max, easier it becomes to run easily. To increase VO2 Max, one needs to run.

In general, body figures out what to do when in rhythm of running. I generally try to breath in and out from nose as much as i can, again not applying force if needs to exhale or inhale via mouth it's okay. When you watch Olympic runners running you'll notice they run with pretty relaxed posture and breathing. Taking full breath is important. Thus, I try to inhale for 2-3 steps then exhale in 2 steps, in case out of breath inhale from nose in 2-3 steps and exhale via mouth.

## Foot strike ?

Defined based on strike of the foot.

It comes naturally, whatever it is it's okay although heel strike in less recommended.

When I started for first 2-3 runs I was heel striker, next 2-3 runs I went with front foot and oh at start muscles were not strong so felt slight pain, later on doing this regular basis not more pain in backfoot.

### Forefoot strike

Forefoot runners land on the ball of their foot or on their toes. As they stride, their heel may not hit the ground at all. This stride can cause your body to lean forward. It may put additional strain on your toes and calf muscles.

Landing on the balls of the feet is considered effective. But landing on the toes may cause injury if you’re a distance runner. Although it’s effective for sprinting and short bursts of speed, landing too far forward on your toes isn’t recommended for longer distances. It could lead to shin splints or other injuries.

Common injuries: You may be more prone to injure your ankle, Achilles tendon, or shins.

### Midfoot strike

Considered the most “neutral” strike, midfoot strikers land in the center of their foot, with their body weight evenly distributed to the ankles, hips, back, and knees. Midfoot runners may be able to run efficiently and with speed.

Common injuries: You may experience foot, ankle, or Achilles pain at some point.

### Heel strike

As mentioned, heel strikers hit the ground with their heels first before the rest of their foot hits the ground. This can put additional strain on the knees. [^1]

Common injuries: You may be more prone to knee and hip pain.

## Running efficiently ?

### Pace (min/km)

This metric represents the time it takes to run one kilometer (min/km). It gives you a clear understanding of how fast you're running.

Monitoring your pace helps in maintaining a steady and consistent speed throughout a run. It’s essential for improving race times or reaching specific goals, as you can adjust your speed based on your target pace.

### Heart Rate (HR)

Your heart rate measures how many times your heart beats per minute (bpm) during a run.

Tracking your heart rate is crucial for understanding effort levels. It helps you ensure you’re training in the correct intensity zone to avoid overexertion or undertraining. It’s especially helpful for endurance training, where maintaining a lower heart rate can allow for longer durations of running.

### Power

Power (measured in watts) reflects the amount of effort or energy output during running.

It allows you to gauge the actual energy you're using to run, independent of pace and terrain. Power-based training can help you improve efficiency, as it enables you to maintain a constant energy output, even if terrain or conditions change.

### Cadence

Cadence is the number of steps you take per minute (spm).

A higher cadence (typically between 170–190 spm) is generally associated with more efficient running and less risk of injury. Focusing on cadence can help you refine your running form and reduce unnecessary impact forces.

| Percentile in Zone | Cadence Range |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| > 95% | >185 spm |
| 70-95% | 174-185 spm |
| 30-69% | 163-173 spm |
| 5-29% | 151-162 spm |
| < 5% | < 151 spm |

### Stride Length

This is the distance covered between each step while running, typically measured in meters.

Improving your stride length can increase your speed without significantly increasing effort. However, it needs to be balanced with cadence to maintain efficiency and avoid overstriding, which can lead to injury.

### Vertical Ratio

Vertical ratio measures the amount of vertical movement (bounce) in relation to stride length, expressed as a percentage.

A lower vertical ratio indicates more efficient forward movement rather than bouncing up and down. Reducing this "bounce" can help conserve energy and make your running motion smoother.

### Vertical Oscillation

Vertical oscillation is the amount of upward movement (in centimeters) during running.

Lower vertical oscillation means less wasted energy in moving up and down. By minimizing vertical movement, you can focus more energy on forward motion, improving your running economy.

### Ground Contact Time (GCT)

GCT is the time your foot spends in contact with the ground during each stride, measured in milliseconds.

Shorter ground contact times often indicate a more efficient, quicker stride. Elite runners tend to have shorter GCT, which can help reduce impact and improve speed.

### Heart Rate Zones

Heart rate zones are ranges of heart rates that correspond to different levels of effort, usually divided into 5 zones, from easy (zone 1) to maximum effort (zone 5).

Training in the appropriate heart rate zones can optimize your workout for different goals, such as fat burning, endurance, or speed. It helps prevent overtraining and ensures you're getting the right intensity in your runs.

### Time in Power Zone

Power zones are similar to heart rate zones, but based on your power output in watts. Time in power zone refers to how long you spend in each zone.

This metric helps balance your power output during different phases of a run. Spending the right amount of time in different power zones can help with endurance, speed training, and efficient energy use.

## Streching

Before each run I do 5 min warm up and post run 5/10 min cooldown.

## Music

When I started my avg cadence was ~120 spm, being more efficient was necessary. I was in <5% runner range who ran at below 151 spm. Music helped me tune as per my target cadence rhythm.

For
spotify users checkout - <https://open.spotify.com/artist/2pvCOW7OAq8uJSnQlL8Yhq>
youtube - <https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCM2RlbR4aNXSKVZfVajvCGQ>

They have beats running at 140, 150, 160, 170, 180 cadence which gives constant feedback to ensure you are running at target rate.

# Result

I ran 100KM in 30 days (Oct 14 2024). Reduced BMI from 24.1 to 22.4. With medium effort I can run 5K in ~35 min, 7.30 min / km pace.

Next steps:

1. 5K - 35 min - DONE
2. 5K - 30 min
3. 10K - 60 min
