# Setting Goals

I am a 27-year-old software engineer writing in the year 2024. I spend most of my time sitting for work, and since grade 12, I've been aspiring to have a six-pack as it's often seen as 'cool.' As a football fan, I'm aware that players typically peak between their late twenties and early thirties, with an analysis by The Athletic[^1] suggesting that the optimal age for different positions ranges from 27 to 31 years old. Thus, I set myself the goal of reaching peak physical fitness by my late twenties.

However, I am more inclined towards outdoor activities than hitting the gym. I would much prefer playing sports outdoors for hours rather than working out indoors. Therefore, I've set a new goal: reducing my body fat percentage to around 8%. This is because everyone has abdominal muscles; they're just hidden beneath layers of fat.

> "The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion." -- Sam Altman ([@sama](https://x.com/sama))

# Plan

Among the various options available for outdoor physical activity, I chose running due to its minimal effort requirement and ease of execution. To facilitate this plan:

_Footwear:_ I wear Skechers running shoes for all my runs.

_Attire:_ I ensure I have comfortable, well-fitting clothing suitable for running.

_Running Routes:_ In urban areas, I prefer peaceful roads and public parks in metropolitan cities.

Given my background in tech, where continuous measurement of metrics helps maintain system efficiency and detect anomalies, I wanted to apply the same principle to my fitness journey. To accurately track progress, I invested in a Garmin watch that records multiple metrics with high precision. The saying "If you can measure it, you can improve it" applies here; tracking quantifiable data enables better understanding of my performance and facilitates continuous growth.

# Execution

To begin my running journey safely, I took things slow initially to minimize the risk of injuries. As a newcomer, it is common to make mistakes, and rushing into intense workouts could lead to strains or other issues. Having previously completed a 4K run in around 38 minutes with no prior preparation, I decided to set a more achievable goal for my initial plan.

I utilized Garmin's AI coach feature to create a personalized running schedule aimed at completing a 5K in approximately 35 minutes – a challenging but manageable target. Fortunately, the AI coach did an excellent job generating a varied training program that included:

- Different types of runs (e.g., steady-paced, interval, and hill training)
- Strategic rest periods to allow for recovery

Now, with my customized plan in hand, I have clear guidance on when and how much to run each day, based on the initial data gathered from my first few sessions. This structured approach has helped me maintain consistency while minimizing the risk of injury.

Let's look at top line metrics that we should chase to become efficient runner.

{{< figure src="running-101-dark.png" title="Metrics" alt="Running metrics optimize" width="auto" >}}

## Metrics

Input metrics[^2] are those we should improve upon through continous training.

- Cadence
- Vertical Ratio
- Vertical Oscillation
- Ground Contact Time

Output metrics are the effect.

- Pace
- HR Zones (Heart Rate)
- Power Zones
- Stride Length

### Cadence

Cadence is the number of times each foot touches the ground in a minute during a running activity. It's measured in steps per minute (spm). Garmin has researched many runners of all different levels. In general, more experienced runners tend to have a higher cadence.

An often-cited target for running cadence is 180 spm. Higher cadences are associated with lower vertical oscillation and shorter ground contact time Taller runners tend to have somewhat lower cadence.

The zones in the table below show the percentile of runners that occupy each zone, as well as the cadence ranges for each zone.

| Percentile in Zone | Cadence Range |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| > 95%              | >185 spm      |
| 70-95%             | 174-185 spm   |
| 30-69%             | 163-173 spm   |
| 5-29%              | 151-162 spm   |
| < 5%               | < 151 spm     |

### Vertical Ratio

Vertical ratio is a way to measure running efficiency.
It divides vertical oscillation by stride length and then shows your ratio as a percentage. Since stride length provides the benefit of running (horizontal movement) and vertical oscillation is an energy cost (vertical movement), a lower vertical ratio indicates a small cost for a large benefit.

The zones in the table below show the percentile of runners that occupy each zone, as well as the vertical ratio ranges for each zone.

| Percentile in Zone | VR Range     |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| > 95%              | < 6.1%       |
| 70 - 95%           | 6.1% - 7.4%  |
| 30 - 69%           | 7.4% - 8.6%  |
| 5 - 29%            | 8.6% - 10.1% |
| < 5%               | > 10.1%      |

### Vertical Oscillation

Vertical oscillation is the amount that the torso moves vertically with each step while running. It's measured in centimeters (cm).

Many running coaches believe that lower vertical oscillation is more economical, because less energy is wasted going up and down. In general, more experienced runners tend to have lower vertical oscillation. However, faster paces often come at a cost of somewhat higher vertical oscillation. Vertical ratio takes this into account. Another advantage of lower vertical oscillation is that it typically means less stress on the lower body at impact.

The zones in the table below show the percentile of runners that occupy each zone, as well as the vertical oscillation ranges for each zone.

| Percentile in Zone | VO Range      |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| > 95%              | < 6.4 cm      |
| > 70 - 95%         | 6.4 - 8.1 cm  |
| > 30 - 69%         | 8.1 - 9.7 cm  |
| > 5 - 29%          | 9.7 - 11.5 cm |
| > < 5%             | 11.5 cm       |

### Ground Contact Time (GCT)

Ground contact time indicates the amount of time that your foot is in contact with the ground on each step, measured in milliseconds (ms). Ground contact time tends to be especially short for elite runners.
Virtually all experienced runners have ground contact times under 300 ms, likely because they have learned to pick up their feet quickly and not to over-stride as they are landing.

The zones in the table below show the percentile of runners that occupy each zone, as well as the ground contact time ranges for each zone.

Adopting a forefoot strike can help to reduce Ground Contact Time (GCT).

| Percentile in Zone | GCT Range    |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| > 95%              | < 208 ms     |
| 70 - 95%           | 208 - 240 ms |
| 30 - 69%           | 241 - 272 ms |
| 5 - 29%            | 273 - 305 ms |
| < 5%               | > 305 ms     |

### Pace (min/km or mile)

This metric represents the time it takes to run one kilometer or mile (min/km). It gives you a clear understanding of how fast you're running.

```latex
Pace ∝ Cadence / (GCT * Vertical Ratio)
```

Focus one metric at a time during training, target higher cadence or lower ground contact time / vertical ratio. Calisthenics exercises helps build strength to reduce the GCT.

### Heart Rate Zones

Heart rate zones are ranges of heart rates that correspond to different levels of effort, usually divided into 5 zones, from easy (zone 1) to maximum effort (zone 5).

Training in the appropriate heart rate zones can optimize your workout for different goals, such as fat burning, endurance, or speed. It helps prevent overtraining and ensures you're getting the right intensity in your runs.

Zone 1

- Heart rate: 50-65% of max. (90-117 bpm for a max of 180)
- Effort: 2-3 out of 10. Breathing easily. Speaking full sentences. Feels like you could go all day!

Zone 2

- Heart rate: 65-80% of max. (90-144 bpm for a max of 180)

- Effort: 3-4 out of 10. Easy to steady endurance. Can still speak in complete sentences.

Zone 3

- Heart rate: 80-85% of max. (145-153 bpm for a max of 180)
- Effort: 4-6 out of 10. Moderate but moving. At the upper end, you get winded quickly if you try to talk and might taste metal.

Zone 4

- Heart rate: 85-92% of max. (154-165 bpm for a max of 180)
- Effort: 6-7 out of 10. Lactate threshold. This is a workout - sentences are clipped. But it's still mostly aerobic. You can hold it for about one hour.

Zone 5

- Heart rate: 92-100% of max. (166-180 bpm for a max of 180)
- Effort: 8-10 out of 10. High-intensity. Everything from very hard VO2 intervals to all-out sprints.

### Power

Power (measured in watts) reflects the amount of effort or energy output during running.

It allows you to gauge the actual energy you're using to run, independent of pace and terrain. Power-based training can help you improve efficiency, as it enables you to maintain a constant energy output, even if terrain or conditions change.

### Stride Length

This is the distance covered between each step while running, typically measured in meters.

Improving your stride length can increase your speed without significantly increasing effort. However, it needs to be balanced with cadence to maintain efficiency and avoid overstriding, which can lead to injury.

{{< youtube id=Jj9ZgQgQvBk start=207 loading=lazy title="Lift costs less energy">}}

### Time in Power Zone

Power zones are similar to heart rate zones, but based on your power output in watts. Time in power zone refers to how long you spend in each zone.

This metric helps balance your power output during different phases of a run. Spending the right amount of time in different power zones can help with endurance, speed training, and efficient energy use.

## Streching

Proper stretching before and after runs plays a vital role in maintaining flexibility, preventing injuries, and enhancing recovery. Here's my approach to stretching before and after my runs.

### Pre-run

{{< youtube id=u-e0ZO5L0s0 loading=lazy >}}

### Post-run

{{< youtube id=taiBlDZhFT4 loading=lazy >}}

## Music

Music plays a crucial role in enhancing my running experience by helping me maintain a consistent pace and cadence. When I began, my average cadence was around 120 steps per minute (spm), placing me in the bottom 5% of runners who maintained cadences below 151 spm. To improve efficiency, focusing on increasing my cadence was essential.

By incorporating these music playlists into my runs, I've found that:

- Time passes more quickly when engaged with captivating tracks that sync with my target cadence.
- Maintaining a consistent pace and cadence is easier with rhythm-driven songs tailored to specific spm ranges.
- Staying motivated and enjoying workouts becomes simpler as music helps create a steady internal metronome for efficient running.

## Nutrition

### Carbohydrates

Carbs are your body's primary source of energy during intense exercise like running. They're stored in your muscles as glycogen. To maintain optimal glycogen levels:

**Time your carbs**: Consume a carbohydrate-rich meal 3-4 hours before your run to ensure proper digestion and energy availability.

**Top up during runs**: For long runs or races, consider consuming easily digestible carbs (like gels or chews) every 45 minutes to maintain blood sugar levels.

### Protein

Protein is essential for muscle recovery and growth. After a run, your muscles need protein to repair micro-tears and build new tissues. Aim for:

**20-30g of protein**: within the first hour after your run.

**Complete proteins**: Opt for sources such as beans, lentils, almonds, tofu, or paneer.

### Healthy Fats

Fats are another essential energy source and play a crucial role in absorbing fat-soluble vitamins. Incorporate healthy fats like:

### Hydration

Water makes up about 60% of our body weight and plays a vital role in every bodily function, including running performance. Here's how to stay hydrated:

**Before, during, and after**: Drink water consistently throughout the day, not just during or after your runs.

**Hydration plan**: Establish a hydration strategy based on your sweat rate (weigh yourself before and after runs to estimate).

### Micronutrients

Vitamins and minerals are crucial for overall health. Focus on eating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to ensure you're getting adequate micronutrients.
