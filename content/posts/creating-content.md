At end of reading this, you'll understand the importance of creating content, when, how you can start.

## When ? 

When one should start creating content and sharing with the world. There is no ideal time, as soon as possible. Start NOW !

## What ?

to write ? serveral options.

1. Pick anything that interest you 
2. One find it easy for you but challenging for others
3. One has put lot of efforts and hard work in learning skill, teach. 
4. Anything out of ordinary, or just simple topic like.

### Quality

How do you figure out quality of content that one would be creating ? 

That depends on 3 things

## Knowledge
With right amount of knowledge one can get lotter better than people with talent. Curiosity drives the knowledge, so ask questions. 
Note; Having knowledge and when it becomes useful to you is non-linear process, you never know :)
### Practice
Bridge between talent and knowledge, given your talent â†’ pracice â†’ growth. 
#### Talent
I am not talented like others so I will put lot more efforts and learn. - At university my project partner, on why he is working too hard. He was right, he is doing very well.


## Why ?

There are several benifits of writing down. Lets go one by one.
1. Brings clarity to thoughts. 
2. Deeper understanding on the subject. 
3. Personal brand
4. Contributing back to the society, Q: how many blogs, videos and other content have you consumed ?
5. Is your writing and thinking are concise and coherent ?

### Not to do.
1. One not comfortable with feedback.
2. Competitive advantage by not sharing. Keeping oneself relevant. 
3. Afraid of trolls.

I have come across many talented folks and wonder, why they are not sharing with the world. One common reason I see "Don't have enough time", something that you can always solve for.

## Where ?
 
### Pick format 

#### Text
1. Website - like this :)
2. Newsletter 
3. Book

#### Audio 
1. Audio podcasts - spotify, youtube
2. Twitter - Audio group call
3. WhatsApp comminity

#### Video 
1. Short form - reels, ticktok
2. Long form - Youtube, coursera, eduction sites.
3. Live - Twitch, YouTube

#### AR/VR
1. Game 
2. Comment on post with ideas.

Your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas. In that order. - Professor Patrick H. Winston

May the force be with you ðŸ§™
