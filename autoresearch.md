# Autoresearch: TigerBeetle Bottleneck — CONCLUDED

## The answer

**LSM read amplification is the bottleneck.** Not CPU, not write bandwidth.

Each transfer triggers ~24 random 8 KB page reads through the LSM tree for
account balance lookups. As data grows, more LSM levels → more reads per lookup → lower throughput.

| DB state | DB size | RPS | Reads/transfer | CPU% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh (1M transfers) | ~2 GB | 64K | 115 KB | 77% |
| Steady-state (10M) | ~20 GB | 46K | 195 KB | 85% |
| Large (12M+) | 33 GB | 27K | 195 KB | 67% |

## Why napkin math couldn't predict this

Sirupsen's write-bandwidth number (3 GiB/s SSD sequential) correctly ruled out
writes as the bottleneck (47K TPS uses only 142 MB/s writes = 11% of ceiling).

But predicting the actual TPS requires knowing:
1. LSM tree depth (depends on data volume)
2. Pages read per lookup (depends on level structure + bloom filters)
3. Random read latency under io_uring (depends on queue depth + SSD)

These are implementation-specific, not generic napkin-math numbers.

**Takeaway: napkin math is best at ruling things OUT (writes, fsync).
The final answer requires measuring.**

## Experiments run

| # | Description | RPS | Key finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baseline (dirty 33GB DB) | 27K | CPU=67%, reads=5 GB/s |
| 2 | Fresh DB, 1M transfers | 64K | CPU=77%, reads=7 GB/s |
| 3 | Batch size sweep 500-8190 | 23K-40K | Sub-linear: ~10ms/batch + ~24µs/transfer |
| 4 | 10M steady-state (definitive) | 46K | CPU=85%, reads=9 GB/s (1.95 TB total!) |
| 5 | Blog updated with conclusion | 46K | LSM read amp = bottleneck |

## Stop condition: MET

We can conclusively state:
1. **What the bottleneck is**: LSM read amplification (195 KB reads per 128 B transfer)
2. **Evidence**: disk read rate near SSD ceiling, throughput tracks DB size
3. **What relaxing it would do**: smaller DB / fewer levels → higher RPS (measured 64K→27K)
