<p>As a backend engineer at FamPay, he finds joy in tackling various engineering challenges and even some non-engineering problems. His passion lies in problem-solving, regardless of the nature of the task at hand.</p>
<h2 id="a-typical-day-in-my-work-life">A Typical Day In My Work Life</h2>
<p>My workday usually starts by going through emails and checking Slack messages where I&rsquo;ve been tagged. I make sure to stay up-to-date with any important communications and address engineering-related issues in public threads, offering my assistance whenever possible.</p>
<p>After that, I focus on the assigned tasks and work on solving the problems at hand. I believe in continuous learning, so I make it a point to discover something new each day. If there are any useful links or resources, I take the time to explore them further and expand my knowledge. Overall, my day is filled with collaborating, problem-solving, and personal growth through <a href="https://www.notion.so/b5b4b75a130f4e9db5fcabed50f7750f?v=40bbd11a1be244549563924afd17634e">learning</a>.</p>
