    After years of playing catch-up with Figma’s growth, it was time to fundamentally rethink LiveGraph’s architecture.
At Figma, multiplayer collaboration is central to everything we do—from file canvas editing to features like comments and FigJam voting sessions. Keeping data up-to-date across product surfaces is critical for effective team collaboration and core to what makes Figma feel magical. LiveGraph, Figma’s real-time data-fetching service, is the foundation that makes this possible.
LiveGraph provides a web API for subscribing to GraphQL-like queries and returns the result as a JSON tree.
